# Software engineering Week 2 Portfolio

The GitHub repository has been created, this is where the project will be updated and shared between all people contributing to the project. 

The first addition to the GitHub was to create a task board, this will be where the project can be split into many separate tasks which can be set between ongoing and completed. This allows all group members to see what is currently being worked on and should allow tasks to be split between members. 

Here is our initial Task Board:

This will be updated and added to the further into the project. 

We are using C# on visual studio as our IDE, all group members are using this to keep consistency as every IDE is different. I have a download of the Visual Studio IDE allowing me to clone the repo and work on the project.
