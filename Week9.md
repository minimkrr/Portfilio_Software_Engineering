# Week 9 continuing creating next issue

## Team Workflow

Again this week i chose a task from te task board and moved to In Development assinged to myself

My task is to create security alerts that can be created and when completed can be marked as resolved. 

# My Task

I have created a page which a security alert can be created and these are saved when the app is stopped running so they dont disapear between runs of the progran. Also there is a resolve button next to each security issue which when pressed removes the issue from the list.
