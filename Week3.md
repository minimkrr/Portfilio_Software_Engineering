#Week 3 portfolio

All tasks are being split into different tasks which each group member will take to work on. Each member has made a new branch for their task which they cant edit and work on and where it can be checked before being added into the main branch. 

The task each member has chosen is assigned to them which they can do themselves or someone else can assign it to them. They can then move the task from "To Do" and change it to "in development". This lets other members know that member is currently working on that task. Once the member thinks the task is done then the task is moved into "In Review" where other members can check they agree with the changes before the task in put into "testing" and then into "done" assuming it worked correctly.

My task includes beiing able to Search, edit delete and view items from the database using the .net maui. I was easily able to make my UI relatively quickly and make sure that is was easy to understand :

![myUI](/Images/myUI.png?raw=true)

![myUIxaml](/Images/pickerInUI.png?raw=true)

I added the picker option for what you wanted to do and blank tect boxes to enter any changes you wanted made to the data. 

I currently know my code is very close to achieviing the goal however I am having a bit of difficulty with the database file not being made when the program realises it currently doesnt exist.  I plan to have it so if the db file does not exist that the program will automatically create it adding any data that was added from the user.
